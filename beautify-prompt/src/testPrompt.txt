Task: Create a function to sort an array of elements

Context: I'm working with JavaScript (or preferred language) and need an efficient sorting implementation.

Expected output: 
1. A well-documented function that sorts an array of elements
2. Clear explanation of the sorting algorithm used
3. Time and space complexity analysis
4. Handling for edge cases (empty arrays, already sorted arrays, etc.)
5. Example usage with different inputs
